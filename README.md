# Prosper Loans Analysis and Visualization
## Introduction
This Prosper loans dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, interest rate, current loan status, 
borrower income, and many others. The main purpose of this project is to see the effect that different loan attributes have on the
loan status. For example, whether high interest rates lead to more defaults or overdue payments or not.

Visualizations of the relationships between different variables are shown in a slideshow.


## Technologies
Python 2.7 or 3.6
